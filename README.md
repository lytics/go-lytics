#Lytics SDK for Go
The Lytics SDK for go offers easy integration with our public REST API endpoints. 
This library is actively being managed and every effort will be made to ensure 
that all handling reflects the best methods available. 
Overview of supported methods outlined below.

## Full REST API Documentation
https://www.getlytics.com/developers/rest-api


## Getting Started
1. Import the library. `go get github.com/lytics/go-lytics`
2. Create a new client from api key.
3. Run one of the many methods to access account info.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	lytics "github.com/lytics/go-lytics"
)

func main() {
	// set your api key
	key := "<YOUR API KEY>"

	// create the client
	client := lytics.NewLytics(key, nil, nil)

	// list all accounts for key
	accounts, err := client.GetAccounts()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	for _, acct := range accounts {
		fmt.Println(acct.Name)
	}
}
```
